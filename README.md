# plandev-ui

The client application for [PlanDev](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/plandev).

## Aerie -> PlanDev Rebrand

This product was **formerly known as Aerie and is now named PlanDev**. While we've updated most documentation and external references, some legacy mentions of the old product name may remain as we complete the transition.

What to know:

- The planning product, including modeling, simulation, scheduling and constraint-checking, is now named PlanDev
- The sequencing product, including the sequence editor, workspaces, and actions, is now named SeqDev
- All features and functionality remain the same
